#### [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Easy

---

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly\*** one solution, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

#### Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        hs = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] not in hs:
                hs[target-nums[i]] = i
            else:
                return [hs[nums[i]], i]
```

When looping through the list, use a dictionary to store it's counterparty with index. Need only 1 pass.
