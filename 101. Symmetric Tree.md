#### [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Easy

---

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

 

But the following `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]` is not:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

#### Solution:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric_iter(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True
        queue = [root, root]
        while queue:
            n1 = queue.pop(0)
            n2 = queue.pop(0)
            if not n1 and not n2:
                continue
            if not n1 or not n2:
                return False
            if n1.val != n2.val:
                return False
            queue.append(n1.left)
            queue.append(n2.right)
            queue.append(n1.right)
            queue.append(n2.left)
        return True
    
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return True
        return Solution.symmetric(root.left, root.right)
    
    @staticmethod
    def symmetric(tree_1, tree_2):
        if not tree_1 and not tree_2:
            return True
        if not tree_1 or not tree_2:
            return False
        return tree_1.val == tree_2.val and Solution.symmetric(tree_1.left, tree_2.right) and Solution.symmetric(tree_1.right, tree_2.left)
```

Recursively: Two trees are symmetric if they have the same root and there 2 children are mirror to each other.

Iteratively: This is a smart use of queue. Each time push and pop 2 nodes that are to be compared. Start with [root, root].
