#### [38. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

Easy

---

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

#### Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        res = '1'
        while n > 1:
            res = self.say(res)
            n -= 1
        return res
        
    def say(self, n: str) -> str:
        x = n[0]
        for i, y in enumerate(n):
            if y != x:
                return str(i) + x + self.say(n[i:])
        return str(i+1) + x
```

The exercise restricts *n* ≤ 30, so it doesn't really matter not to be tail-recursive. Tail-recursive (but slightly slower) version as below:

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        res = '1'
        while n > 1:
            res = self.say(res, '')
            n -= 1
        return res
         
    def say(self, n: str, prefix: str) -> str:
        x = n[0]
        for i, y in enumerate(n):
            if y != x:
                return self.say(n[i:], prefix + str(i) + x)
        return prefix + str(i+1) + x
```
