#### [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Easy

---

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return *the reversed list*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

#### Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev = None
        while head:
            forward = head.next
            head.next = prev
            prev = head
            head = forward
        return prev
```

This is that kind of questions I don't like. It is so simple that requires nearly no thinking, while so hard to memorize with the 3 points switching one another. Only way to answer the question is to recite the solution.
