#### [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

Medium

---

Given a string **s**, find the longest palindromic substring in **s**. You may assume that the maximum length of **s** is 1000.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

#### Solution 1:

Manacher's Algorithm, 152 ms

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        if len(s) < 2:
            return s
        
        m = [0 for _ in range(2*len(s)+1)] # numbers in here are string lengths
        curr_p = Palindrome(1, 3)
        max_p = curr_p
        
        m[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, len(m)):
            # case A: outside current palindrome, just grow and update
            if i > curr_p.right_mana_ind:
                curr_p = Palindrome.grow(s, i, 1)
                m[i] = curr_p.str_length
                if curr_p.str_length > max_p.str_length:
                    max_p = curr_p
            
            # case B: inside current palindrome, go look at the mirror place
            else:
                mirror = curr_p.mirror_pos(i)
                distance = curr_p.dist_to_right(i)
            
                # case B-1: mirror palindrome is properly contained in the current palindrome, copy
                if m[mirror] < distance:
                    m[i] = m[mirror]
                    continue
            
                # case B-2: mirror palindrome is not contained in the current palindrome, truncate
                elif m[mirror] > distance:
                    m[i] = distance
                    continue

                # case B-3: mirror palindrome is a prefix of the current palindrome, grow
                else:
                    p = Palindrome.grow(s, i, distance)
                    m[i] = p.str_length

                    if p.str_length > max_p.str_length:
                        max_p = p

                    # case B-3-1: if successfully grown, update the current palindrome
                    if p.right_mana_ind > curr_p.right_mana_ind:
                        curr_p = p

            # stop when curr_p reach the end of string
            if curr_p.right_mana_ind == len(m) - 1:
                return s[max_p.left_str_ind: max_p.right_str_ind+1]
            

class Palindrome:
    def __init__(self, center_mana_ind, mana_length):
        self.center_mana_ind = center_mana_ind
        self.mana_length = mana_length # this is always an odd number
        self.half_mana_length = (self.mana_length - 1) // 2
        self.left_mana_ind = self.center_mana_ind - self.half_mana_length
        self.right_mana_ind = self.center_mana_ind + self.half_mana_length
        
        self.str_length = (self.mana_length - 1) // 2
        self.left_str_ind = self.left_mana_ind // 2
        self.right_str_ind = self.right_mana_ind // 2 - 1

    def mirror_pos(self, i):
        return 2 * self.center_mana_ind - i
    
    def dist_to_right(self, i):
        return self.right_mana_ind - i
    
    @staticmethod
    def grow(string, mana_ind, known_length):
        i = (mana_ind - known_length) // 2 - 1
        j = (mana_ind + known_length) // 2
        
        while i >= 0 and j < len(string) and string[i] == string[j]:
            known_length += 2
            i -= 1
            j += 1
        return Palindrome(mana_ind, 2*known_length+1)
```

This solution aims to elaborate the Manacher's Algorithm. If you are not interested in learning advance algorithms but just wanted to have a good solution for a tech interview, skip this one and read solution 2.

I spent a few hours to understand the Manacher's Algorithm and implement this solution. I feel the idea of this algorithm is actually not at all difficult to understand (compare to any advanced mathematics) but it is not easy to explain it in a concise and clear way. For example, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-sEwsca1ak) is short but explained poorly, while [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/manachers-algorithm-linear-time-longest-palindromic-substring-part-1/) explains it well but being super long. 

A working code needs not to have as many lines as my solution here. The definition of the `Palindrome` class is not necessary and many logic can be combined or reduced. I write it this way just to make the thinking process clear and neat:

- Make Manacher's Array
- Start looping for `i`= 2:
  - if outside a bigger palindrome: grow a palindrome
  - if inside a bigger palindrome: check out the mirror place
    - if mirror palindrome is properly contained in the current palindrome: just copy
    - if mirror palindrome is not contained in the current palindrome: just truncate
    - if mirror palindrome is a prefix of the current palindrome: grow
      - if not grown bigger: do nothing and go check the next `i`
      - if grown bigger: update the bigger palindrome
  - stop early when we get a palindrome that reaches the end of the string, since no more longer palindrome can be found going forward. This is solely for this exercise.



#### Solution 2:

Span from center, 1080 ms

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        if len(s) < 2:
            return s
        max_p = s[0]     
        for i in range(2, 2*len(s)+1):
            p = grow(s, i, 0 if i % 2 == 0 else 1)
            if len(p) > len(max_p):
                max_p = p
        return max_p

def grow(string, mana_ind, length):
    i = (mana_ind) // 2 - 1
    j = (mana_ind + length) // 2

    while i >= 0 and j < len(string) and string[i] == string[j]:
        length += 2
        i -= 1
        j += 1
    return string[i+1:j]
```
