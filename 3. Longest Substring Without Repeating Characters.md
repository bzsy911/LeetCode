Medium

---

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

#### Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        i = j = 0
        l = len(s)
        hs = set()
        curr = 0
        while j < l:
            if s[j] not in hs:
                hs.add(s[j])
                curr += 1
                res = max(curr, res)
                j += 1
            else:
                while s[j] in hs and i < j:
                    hs.remove(s[i])
                    curr -= 1
                    i += 1
        return res
```

Two pointers. When the forward one sees a met letter, the second one start to move an eliminate all met letters.
