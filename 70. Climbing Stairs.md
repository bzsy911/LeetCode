#### [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

Easy

---

You are climbing a stair case. It takes *n* steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given *n* will be a positive integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

#### Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = [1, 1]
        for _ in range(n-1):
            res.append(res[-1] + res[-2])
        return res[-1]
```

This is clearly nothing but the Fibonacci sequence.
