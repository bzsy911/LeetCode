#### [205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

Easy

---

Given two strings `s` and `t`, *determine if they are isomorphic*.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

#### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        return self.mapping(s, t) and self.mapping(t, s)
    
    def mapping(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        dict = {}
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] not in dict:
                dict[s[i]] = t[i]
            else:
                if dict[s[i]] != t[i]:
                    return False
        return True
```
