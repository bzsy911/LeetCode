#### [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

Easy

---

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` *if* `n` *is a happy number, and* `false` *if not*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

#### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        cycle = set()
        while n != 1:
            cycle.add(n)
            n = self.op(n)
            if n in cycle:
                return False
        return True
    
    def op(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n > 0:
            res += (n % 10) ** 2
            n = n // 10
        return res
```

With a little more math knowledge, we can do an easier solution, see [here](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/03/24/squared-digit-sum/)

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        attractors = [1, 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20]
        while n not in attractors:
            n = self.sum_2(n)
        return n == 1
    
    def sum_2(self, n):
        return sum([int(n)**2 for n in str(n)])
```
