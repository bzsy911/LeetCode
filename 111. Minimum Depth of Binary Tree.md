#### [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Easy

---

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```

#### Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            return 1
        if root.left and not root.right:
            return self.minDepth(root.left) + 1
        if root.right and not root.left:
            return self.minDepth(root.right) + 1
        
        return min(self.minDepth(root.left), self.minDepth(root.right)) + 1
```

Have to explicitly check the cases of children -- simply using the last line of recursion won't work, because when there is ONE child, the other None child is not a valid path and shouldn't be counted.
