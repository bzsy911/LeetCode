#### [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

Easy

---

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

#### Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x < 2:
            return x

        i = 1
        j = x // 2

        while i+1 < j:
            mid = (i + j) // 2
            if mid * mid < x:
                i = mid
            else:
                j = mid
        
        return j if j * j <= x else i
```

This is to find the maximum integer whose square is less than `x`. Thus it is a binary search problem.
