#### [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

Medium

---

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

#### Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 0
        j = len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        while i < j:
            max_area = max(max_area, min(height[i], height[j]) * (j-i))
            if height[i] <= height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return max_area
```

This is an interesting problem. Obviously there is the $O(n^2)$ solution which computes the area between every 2 bars. The idea behind this $O(n)$ solution is that suppose `h[0]`<`h[n-1]`, then the area between `0` and `n-1` is the maximum among all the containers with `0` as its left bar. Therefore we don't need to check `[0, n-2]`, `[0, n-3]`, ... ,`[0, 1]`.
