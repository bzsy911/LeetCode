#### [7. Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

Easy

---

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```

**Note:**
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [$-2^{31}$, $2^{31}-1$]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

#### Solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    
    def reverse(self, x):
        sign = 2 * (x > 0) - 1
        x = abs(x)
        res = 0
        while x > 0:
            x, r = divmod(x, 10)
            res = res * 10 + r
        res *= sign
        if res > 2147483647 or res < -2147483648:
            return 0
        return res
```

Python 3 doesn't restrict integer ranges. Free feel to construct numbers as large as your REM can contain.
