#### [6. ZigZag Conversion](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/)

Medium

---

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```

And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

```
string convert(string s, int numRows);
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:

P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```

#### Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        if numRows == 1 or len(s) <= numRows:
            return s
        step = 2 * (numRows - 1)
        return ''.join([self.the_k_th_row(s, step, k) for k in range(1, numRows+1)])
    
    def the_k_th_row(self, s: str, step: int, k: int) -> str:
        vertical = s[k-1::step]   
        if k == 1 or k == step // 2 + 1:
            return vertical
        else:
            slope = s[step-(k-1)::step]
            if len(slope) < len(vertical):
                slope += ' '
            return ''.join([x for pair in zip(vertical, slope) for x in pair]).strip()
```

Let $n$ be the number of rows givens, a few observations:

- If $n=1$ or `len(s)`$\leq n$, there is no zig-zag. The output is just the original string.
- The first row and the last row are arithmetic sequences with steps equal to $2(n-1)$.
- For the rows in between, there are 2 parts, the letter on the vertical bar and the letter on the slope.
- For the $k$-th row, where $1<k<n-1$, the letters on the vertical bars are `s[k-1::step]` and the letters on the slopes are `s[step-(k-1)::step]`
- The final $k$-th row is the interleaving string of `vertical` and `slope`. Be careful that the `zip` function will ignore the longer tail. So use a space to make them the same length and remember to get rid of it when finished.
