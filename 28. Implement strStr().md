#### [28. Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)

Easy

---

Implement [strStr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or **-1** if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

#### Solution:

KMP implementation, 44ms.

```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        if not needle:
            return 0
        kmp = self.build_kmp(needle)
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < len(haystack) and j < len(needle):
            if haystack[i] == needle[j]:
                i += 1
                j += 1
            elif j > 0:
                j = kmp[j-1]
            else:
                i += 1
        return i -j if j == len(needle) else -1
    
    
    def build_kmp(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        if not s:
            return []
        i = 0
        j = 1
        res = [0]
        while j < len(s):
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                res.append(i+1)
                i += 1
                j += 1
            elif i > 0:
                i = res[i-1]
            else:
                res.append(0)
                j += 1
        return res
```

To identify `substr` in `Str`, the spirit of KMP is not to look back `Str` at all.  In order to do that without loss of tracking, the key is to know a special structural feature of the `substr` -- given any index `i`, how much is the partial string `substr[:i]` "palindromic". The `build_kmp` function is to construct an array that saves such information. Fox example:

```
Input: build_kmp('aabaabaaa')
OUtput: [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2]
```

The time complexity of KMP algorithm is `O(m+n)` and space complexity is `O(n)` for the array.

By the way, the Python 3 build-in string method `index()` takes 24ms, almost as twice fast as my KMP. How is it implemented?

```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        try:
            return haystack.index(needle)
        except ValueError:
            return -1
```
