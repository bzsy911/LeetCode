#### [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

Easy

---

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return *the majority element*.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

---

#### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        res = None
        for n in nums:
            if count == 0:
                res = n
            count += (1 if n == res else -1)
        return res
```

Voting algorithm. The idea is that the majority element of the suffix is invariant given that there is less or equal majority element than minority elements in the prefix.
