#### [234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)

Easy

---

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/pal2linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

 

**Follow up:** Could you do it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?

#### Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        # short list cases
        if not (head and head.next):
            return True
        if not head.next.next:
            return head.val == head.next.val
        
        # look for the midpoint
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        # reverse the 2nd half
        fast = self.reverse(slow.next)
        slow.next = None
        slow = head
        
        # compare the 2 pieces
        while slow and fast:
            if slow.val != fast.val:
                return False
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        return True

    
    def reverse(self, head):
        prev = None
        while head:
            forward = head.next
            head.next = prev
            prev = head
            head = forward
        return prev
```
