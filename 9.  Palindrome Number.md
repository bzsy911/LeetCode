#### [9.  Palindrome Number]( https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/ ) 

Easy

---

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 121
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Follow up:**

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

#### Solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        if x < 0 or (x != 0 and x % 10 == 0):
            return False
        rev = 0
        while x > rev:
            x, r = divmod(x, 10)
            rev = rev * 10 + r
        return x == rev or x == rev // 10
```

- Firstly eliminate trivial cases. 

- Find the reverse number and compare. 
- Stop at half way. The way to detect half way is that the remaining x is no longer larger than reverted.
