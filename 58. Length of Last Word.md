Given a string *s* consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters `' '`, return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

**Note:** A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

```

#### Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        i = len(s) - 1
        
        while i >= 0 and s[i] == ' ':
            i -= 1
        
        j = i
        while j >= 0 and s[j] != ' ':
            j -= 1
        
        return i - j
```

Straightforward.
