#### [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

Easy

---

Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

#### Solution

```python
# 64.01%, 6.90%
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s = [x.lower() for x in s if x.isalnum()]
        return s == s[::-1]
```

The pythonic solution is usually much easier to implement and, surprisingly, faster than your smart solutions. You can really trust python.

```python
# 48.01%, 93.36%
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        p1 = 0
        p2 = len(s)-1
        while p2 > p1:
            if not s[p1].isalnum():
                p1 += 1
                continue
            if not s[p2].isalnum():
                p2 -= 1
                continue
            if s[p1].lower() != s[p2].lower():
                return False
            p1 += 1
            p2 -= 1
        return True
```

This is a 2-way forward, 1-pass, early stop solution. But it's slower than python build-ins.
